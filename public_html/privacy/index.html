			<h2><br><br>Google</h2>

They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users (<a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en">AdWords policy</a>). We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.</p>




			<h2><br><br>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>

			<p><br>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. (<a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">See more</a>)</p>




			<h2><br><br>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h2>

			<h2><br><br>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h2>

			<p><br>It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking.</p>




			<h2><br><br>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>

			<p><br>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.<br><br>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>




			<h2><br><br>Fair Information Practices</h2>

			<p><br>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>




			<h2><br><br>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</h2>

			<p><br>We will notify you via email within 7 business days.<br><br>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>




			<h2><br><br>CAN SPAM Act</h2>

			<p><br>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>




			<h2><br><br>We collect your email address in order to:</h2>

			<p><br>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</p>




			<h2><br><br>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</h2>

			
				<p><br>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</p>
      			<p>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</p>
      			<p>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</p>
      			<p>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</p>
      			<p>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</p>
